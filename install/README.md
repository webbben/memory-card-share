# Installing Dependencies

I put these scripts together (well, with lots of help from my good friend Chatgpt...) to hopefully make installing the dependencies easier.
I didn't do the due diligence of testing these out on their respective operating systems, so I can't guarantee they work.
Give them a shot, but if you run into problems you may need to run through the manual instructions in the readme at the project root.

### Windows

run the powershell script `install-python-windows.ps1`

### Mac

run the bash script `install-python-mac.sh`

### Debian/Ubuntu

run the bash script `install-python-debian.sh`
