# Installation Scripts

I put together some scripts to make installation easier. To use a script, I recommend downloading it individually from here and running it. Ideally these are all run with administrator/root privileges so they don't get stopped by permissions.

You can download an individual script by clicking on it to go to its page, and then using the ellipse button on the top right:

### Windows
Most of you use Windows, so more effort has gone into streamlining this process :)

1) run the powershell script `install-python-windows.ps1`
    * this installs the dependencies we need for this program to work
3) run the batch script `setup-windows-default.bat`
    * this puts the cloned repo folder on your desktop and sets it up for use

### Mac

run the bash script `install-python-mac.sh`

### Debian/Ubuntu

run the bash script `install-python-debian.sh`
